      "Cool.\n",
      "All right, so again, this is also going to, this would be a good segue after right after I show where the dashboard is and what it looks like, it's a good segue into to workspaces as well, right?\n",

      "Masduki, Issy left the meeting\n",

      "I have this blank canvas right?\n",
      "So now let me go back.\n",
      "Into my workspace.\n",
      "Let's check out.\n",
      "This is the the this report, by the way. Right.\n",
      "Report that you're familiar with.\n",
      "I've published it already, but just imagine I published it again, right?\n",
      "You'll see it here.\n",
      "So you can see that.\n",
      "When I am on the report online, I'm now able, if you notice here, right as I go over any of the visuals, I can pin them.\n",
      "You see this pin visual that pops up?\n",
      "Actually don't know which one this is pointing to because they're so close to each other, but so let me go to another page that's    the decomposition.\n",
      "OK, there it is.\n",
      "OK, you dash  .\n",
      "I can.\n",
      "I can pin it to a new dashboard also, but we just create a new dash one, so let's go there.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So now let's go back to New Dash  .\n",
      "You zoom out a little bit, I think I'm zoomed in.\n",
      "Yeah, we do that.\n",
      "It's a little better, so now you can see that I can.\n",
      "This is this is an example of a tile I can make this smaller.\n",
      "I can make it larger, right?\n",
      "And if I click on it and and get into it right, I can.\n",
      "I can see it's not quite as interactive, right?\n",
      "Unless you pin the whole page, it's not quite as interactive.\n",
      "You just see them information, so better candidate.\n",
      "For this would be.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Let's see something like this.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Tech profit margin.\n",
      "This might be something that's high level enough that someone might actually wanna take a look at it, right?\n",
      "So I might look something like this.\n",
      "I can even go to a different report and pin visuals right?\n",
      "But they're not going there.\n",
      "It's not the same as I I'm not going to be able to filter this right?\n",
      "This isn't gonna filter this and so forth, so it's not exactly a report.\n",
      "It's much more of no.\n",
      "And when you when you click on some of the visuals that will take you directly into the report on the page that you wanna take a look at, right.\n",
      "So let's go back.\n",
      "So if I want to edit.\n",
      "I can move this around so side and so forth, right?\n",
      "I can add other tiles, I can add some image if I want to.\n",
      "You'll actually do that in one of your labs, but I I can provide some image.\n",
      "Give, give it.\n",
      "Give it a title and subtitle and and so forth.\n",
      "So if I wanna put my logo right, I can do that?\n",
      "Umm, so for superstore analysis, I can put some logo and things like that, put it on the side, move that around.\n",
      "But that's kind of the mechanics of it.\n",
      "Again, if I click into this, it'll take me into that visual, right?\n",
      "But these don't interact right, and there's a lot of other niche features.\n",
      "Also, you can subscribe to our dashboard as well, right?\n",
      "Does that make sense of our?\n",
      "Any questions on what I just showed you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "So couple of questions, Arvin, so you made a statement that the slicers, let's assume on our report there was a slicer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "And we ping that slicer on the dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "Will that allow the group viewing the dashboard slice the data?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "No, but there's a better way to do it.\n",
      "You wouldn't do it individually like that, so if you want that functionality, let me show you how that's done.\n",
      "So let's say there's a slicer, right like you said, asked for it's right there, right?\n",
      "So maybe.\n",
      "You want to pin this whole page, right?\n",
      "You can do that so I can say hey pin this whole page to a new dash  .\n",
      "Now I can go to that dashboard.\n",
      "See here that the whole page is there, right?\n",
      "So this will slice everything on that page, including this tech profit margin card that I put in there, right?\n",
      "But and and these will just still act like the same way that it would on on the report.\n",
      "But it's only for that page that page is getting pulled in and it'll act like that, right?\n",
      "So that's the better way to do it.\n",
      "You can't just pin a slicer and pin a another visual and make them work together.\n",
      "They won't interact that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "So on this page, once we've been a page, we cannot add another visual from from a different page or from a different report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barrera Parra, Carlos   joined the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "No, they won't interact in the same way.\n",
      "If you want that, you should put it in a page.\n",
      "The whole point of this is it's not to even this feature the the one that you you see added it kind of takes a takes it away from being a true dashboard.\n",

      "Mecmajer, Maciej joined the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "A dashboard is not a place where you do a.\n",
      "It's generally not the best place to do all the you know, slicing and dicing of things.\n",
      "It's to see it's to see at a high level what's going on, right.\n",
      "And if you really want to know what's going on, you wanna slice this, you just click on this and go into that page that it's coming from and take a look at it and mess around with it, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "And I went for example, if the report page is by mistake deleted, will the dashboard will also become unusable?\n",

      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "I mean, yeah, it should, because if you don't, it's getting it.\n",

      "So if you don't have a data source for it, it's not going to show up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",

      "OK, so let's try forecast.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So let me say, let's say you wanna pin this page.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just wanna add one more thing to that.\n",
      "To that point I I would get confused as to why I couldn't add visualizations from different reports and it and expect them to interact together, and then it done on me that it's because these are all being driven by the by the same data model and therefore if those interactions don't exist, then you can't have them.\n",
      "You can't have them interacting on on a dashboard, plus there are also at the page at the page level.\n",
      "So you're that.\n",
      "We're we're breaking breaking the page.\n",
      "So what we can do though is take visualizations from different reports, which is super cool, but also that even more so is gonna.\n",
      "They're gonna be independent because again, they're not sharing the same the same data model.\n",

      "If they're coming from different reports, they shouldn't filter each other and that can cause confusion for the users, right?\n",
      "Umm yeah.\n",
      "Anyways, great observation.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So that's a little bit about dashboards.\n",
      "So the dashboards I think is a good segue are always placed in something called a workspace, right?\n",
      "So we want to understand what a workspace we'll come back in a dashboards, we'll look at some stuff like real time dashboards and all that, but let's quickly make a detour and understand what a workspace is.\n",
      "Because if you don't, at least at a high level, understand what a workspace is, you're going to have.\n",
      "It's not going to make sense, right? So.\n",
      "I know this is this is kind of later and you're reading for this week.\n",
      "So I will not ask you about what a workspace is, but I'll just define it right.\n",
      "It's a repository.\n",
      "For your data assets.\n",
      "What do I mean by data assets?\n",
      "Dashboards.\n",
      "Reports.\n",
      "Data sets.\n",
      "Data flows.\n",
      "And more and more are coming by the day, right?\n",
      "There's now like a data warehouse that's also there and you know now more and more assets are going to be there.\n",
      "Uh, you know, especially as fabric gets introduced.\n",
      "But for now, what does GA is?\n",
      "You'll see things like this reports, dashboards, data sets, and even apps, but we'll get into that at another time.\n",
      "What apps are right?\n",
      "Umm, so.\n",
      "So you're gonna see all of this, right?\n",
      "And why do we have that?\n",
      "Repositories make it easier to collaborate.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Much, much easier to collaborate. Umm.\n",
      "On top of that, you also can enable security, right?\n",
      "You can put.\n",
      "You can set security standards.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Whether it is you don't want someone to, you can block people from, you know, accessing the underlying data source.\n",
      "You can make sure the only the right people are you know are accessing your data.\n",
      "So like RBAC right rollback role based access control right?\n",
      "So that means like, you know, only if you're like for example deemed as a viewer, you can't be able to see certain things and we'll get into that a little bit, right?\n",
      "So that's why we use workspaces.\n",
      "So let's take a look at what it looks like.\n",
      "On powerbar.com, so power bi.com is where you'll see your.\n",
      "That's where your workspace resides, right?\n",
      "It's it's an online place, right?\n",
      "We don't want to keep it local.\n",
      "Now that's some good visuals here.\n",
      "OK, so let's take a look and there's a lot of there's some other features, some more advanced features that I'm not going to get into today like deployment pipelines and all that.\n",
      "Something Joe cover.\n",
      "OK, alright, so let's get into my workspace.\n",
      "I'm already here.\n",
      "There's also something called my workspace.\n",
      "It has some limitations, right in terms of what you can create and not create, but let's just focus on a generic workspace.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Again, I have almost all the different types of assets right?\n",
      "I have a data flow I've a report.\n",
      "I have a data set.\n",
      "Uh data set is, by the way, your model, right?\n",
      "You're underlying data model.\n",
      "This is your data set.\n",
      "This is your data set data set data model.\n",
      "Or, uh, they're used some they're used as synonyms, right and.\n",
      "And that that data model that you create gets refreshed, right?\n",
      "And, you know, powers everything else that we talked about.\n",
      "Power your we have to use something called Store Park.\n",
      "Again, I'm not gonna get into that.\n",
      "So a little more tranced.\n",
      "So you have all of it right here, right.\n",
      "You have all of it.\n",
      "Some people even upload their data here, right?\n",
      "And your data flow, by the way, is just umm, power query online, right?\n",
      "So that's what that is.\n",
      "So if you're curious about that, that's what that is.\n",
      "And I can easily filter in by the type that I have.\n",
      "I can filter by the owner, right?\n",
      "Do all kinds of things, and I can even view it in a different way and I'll show you that in a bit, but more importantly, let me talk about, umm, let me talk about the access.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So there's different types of access, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "ZaidKoreishi left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "When you when you get into your workspace, you can have someone that's an admin, right?\n",
      "I want to give.\n",
      "So there's three different types, right?\n",
      "There's viewers or four different types like admin, member, contributor, viewer and admin can do pretty much everything.\n",
      "They can delete the workspace, they can add people in, umm, uh, and delete assets they they pretty much have super user control, right?\n",
      "Members can do almost everything, but they can't delete the workspace, right?\n",
      "And obviously they can also create reports, dashboards, apps and so forth.\n",
      "If contributor can create reports and dashboards, but they can't create apps and they can't, you know, add people to the workspace, they can't.\n",
      "They're not allowed to do that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And the viewer can't do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uday G Shastri left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Pretty much can't do much.\n",
      "They can only view uh the assets especially, can mainly view the reports, right?\n",
      "So they're really limited and it's pretty simple the way it works.\n",
      "You just add someone in.\n",
      "So let's say I want Joe.\n",
      "And I don't want him to be an avid I want to be a member.\n",
      "I just add him like so and then he gets access to my workspace.\n",
      "He gets access to all my work and so forth.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So you can do that.\n",
      "Generally speaking, people might add.\n",
      "Add a group of people right there.\n",
      "Uh, you have something called Azure directory groups, right?\n",
      "That's an Azure feature, so they might add people in a group and just put them all as members, right?\n",
      "Umm so it's like having an email subscriber group where you have more people, you add them in, they get access accordingly.\n",
      "Any other questions you came off from here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fry, Anthony        \n",
      "That no, I was just scratching my ear.\n",
      "\n",

      "Solving this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Ohh no worries.\n",
      "Yeah, Jamal, did you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "But this excess will give uh the Members or the OR the viewers access to all your workspaces.\n",
      "Or do you have to specify workspace as well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah, I mean, this is the just for this workspace.\n",
      "This is not for all the workspaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "OK, so you have to select one workforce and then add people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "This is for the.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yep, Yep, that's how it works.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Uh, so yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Yep, that's a better way to put it.\n",
      "Distribution list, right?\n",
      "And that's what pretty much in a handy group is, right?\n",
      "So yeah, so that that's what that's mainly what it is, right? Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "So let's so, Arvin, let's assume I'm.\n",
      "I know I'm asking some silly questions here, but let's assume let's assume I have a, you know, pro license for this thing for BI service and I want to give the access to a friend of mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "That friend of mine should also must also have a license to be able to view the reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "When you want people to be a viewer, they need to be able to sign into power BI, right?\n",
      "And they need to be some kind of a user, right?\n",
      "So there there are.\n",
      "Nonpro light like they're they're there is like pro like the regular license and so forth.\n",
      "But there's a better way to actually send some of your assets to people that don't have licenses either, and that's called an app, but I'll I don't wanna touch in touch on that because that's something Joel cover, but that's a good question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal          \n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah, but generally speaking, this is for people that are in your organization, right?\n",
      "I I wouldn't give this.\n",
      "This is not the mechanism through which I like.\n",
      "I might let you know someone else in my org see this stuff or be a viewer, but I'm not going to usually give it to someone that's outside of my org or someone that is not even you know that that I'm not even collaborating, collaborating with right.\n",
      "If I was working with the consultant, maybe they get access right, but outside of that there's a better way for you to kind of disseminate or distribute this information to outside sources without letting them see the kitchen, so to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smith, Jennifer left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Great.\n",
      "I don't want people to see all the all the things that I have here.\n",
      "There's a better way for people to just see my reports.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So that's a little bit about that.\n",
      "There's different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "So in the one in one workspace like if you have a    reports right, how can I give the?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah, go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "I don't want the group of one group of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florencia Eugenia Mendoza left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Yeah, I want to give one group of team should have access to only one report out of    reports.\n",
      "So how can I set that like report level security or?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So for that you're going to use an app, right?\n",
      "You're not going to give people access to the whole report.\n",
      "The this is too coarse, right?\n",
      "You wanna get more granular is what you're you want like out of the end reports you only want one or two reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "You're going to use something called an app and and again, you know, feel free to look it up, but I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "I really, really don't wanna steal Jose Thunder here, but she talked about in detail, but basically just a little spoiler, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "OK search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "It it's it's the more granular way to share your assets, your especially reports?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So long key I saw your hand up also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solanki, Akshaykumar M        \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So uh, just a small question.\n",
      "Can we share report with someone without sharing the data set used in that report and will they be able to see it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That yes, that's that's what I mentioned with the app, right? Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solanki, Akshaykumar M        \n",
      "OK, OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Basically you you'll see that in more detail later, but yeah, it's you can create something called an app here, right?\n",
      "I already created one for this and once you put that in you can decide what you wanna share, right?\n",
      "And and that's that's kind of how it works.\n",
      "Again, you'll see that in more detail we'll talk about and manage datasets.\n",
      "We have a whole chalk talk for that where we talk about managed data sets and how to.\n",
      "There's a lot of cool features within the workspace and I know you really, really wanna know it, but just wait two days and you'll you'll find out.\n",
      "Umm, so that's a little bit about that again.\n",
      "We also learn more about refreshes and all that, but I just want to touch on one other thing that's important, right?\n",
      "Or two things.\n",
      "One is this this thing called Lineage view.\n",
      "This is really good for troubleshooting.\n",
      "It allows you to see where you came from, right?\n",
      "Or where are your data came from that where you came from comes from, you know, other services like ancestry.com, right?\n",
      "But at this is ancestry.com for your for your data right?\n",
      "And it's really, really useful for you to see.\n",
      "What data set or what data it it's kind of the   ,    foot view you can see what is influencing your dashboard report and so forth.\n",
      "So if something fails, you know, OK, let me go take a look at the Excel file or let me go look at that database and so forth, right.\n",
      "So it's really really useful for that.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "From that perspective, right and one last thing about workspaces, before I put this, you know before I'm done with work spaces is the fact that we have something called security features, right?\n",
      "It's kind of important to know that.\n",
      "But within your data set.\n",
      "You have you have certain security settings right and basically you can allow certain people to see it and you can also.\n",
      "You can also configure.\n",
      "If uh.\n",
      "If certain people are like how like if certain features and this again depends on the level of permission you have, but you can make it so that people can't export data from your.\n",
      "From your report.\n",
      "So you don't want any data leakages, right?\n",
      "So you can make sure that you put some sensitivity labels on your workspace.\n",
      "I mean on your data set, so the underlying data set, no matter where it's used, right, we we know that the data set fuels the report, the dashboard, the app and all everything else, right?\n",
      "So if you put the right label, you're going to save yourself a lot of a lot of time and you know, and you're gonna save your company from data leaks if you care about that. Right?\n",
      "So keep that in mind.\n",
      "So that's all that's my that's my high level overview of what a workspace is.\n",
      "Any questions within the scope of what I talked about?\n",
      "Did it all make sense?\n",
      "Any questions on what I've just talked about for the last    minutes?\n",
      "All right, put a thumbs up.\n",
      "If it all makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Just one question, Aravind.\n",
      "Like let's say user is related to the sales OK and he wants to access the finance related data from one of these dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "And.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "How can we achieve it?\n",
      "Like what kind of security?\n",
      "Because we can't provide the entire access to the finance folder, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, if you have your data set under your dataset, you make it confidential.\n",
      "They can extract anything.\n",
      "You can't.\n",
      "Uh, like if, if I like I showed you before, right?\n",
      "Just very here.\n",
      "If I go there and make sure that my sensitivity label is highly confidential or if it's public, anyone can take anything, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "I don't want that, so I'm making maybe highly confidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danni Brown joined the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Pavan Pratap        \n",
      "Got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "And and so forth.\n",
      "And that way no one can extract anything, but in general, generally speaking, with people are consuming your report, they're not going to be able to.\n",
      "Extract.\n",
      "Uh, like, they're they're not gonna be able to see your underlying database like they're not, but the the point of these confidential features and all that is so that the there are any leakages, right.\n",
      "There are features in Power BI that allow you to so when you publish something right, you can extract just this data by saying export data and this is useful if you wanna share within your company and people wanna take a look at the underlying data to validate something or double check your work or something like that.\n",
      "I the that's not a problem, right?\n",
      "And you can also do show to show us a table there and you can see some of the underlying data, right?\n",
      "And this might not be good for some people, right?\n",
      "They don't want to give that level of access, so you can save yourself from any data leakages by putting those labels, and Microsoft is going to.\n",
      "Microsoft is going to protect your protect your your data right or data sovereignty S people call it.\n",
      "Alright, so that's a little bit about uh workspaces.\n",
      "Thank you, Pavan, for for the questions.\n",
      "Alright, so let's go back to dashboards.\n",
      "Let's see what else we have to, uh, pick up here, right.\n",
      "Uh, so we talked about data protection.\n",
      "We looked at least I think OK.\n",
      "Ohh, I think uh, that part will cover by by Joe.\n",
      "There's also a part where we can monitor the performance or reports, but I think that's a little more advanced.\n",
      "OK so.\n",
      "Let's go back to dashboards and let's take a look at Bernie saw this dashboard.\n",
      "So let's take a look at a real time dashboard.\n",
      "Let me see if I have an example.\n",
      "Here I used to have one, but I might have deleted it.\n",
      "Ohh, let me also talk about some of these features so within you know within this feature you can also have themes right?\n",
      "So I can make it like dark custom.\n",
      "So if I have a custom theme for my for my organization right, I can I can apply that theme so that it always follows that red?\n",
      "I can make it also color blind friendly because you know some astonishing statistic.\n",
      "You know, it's like  % of people are color blind or something like that.\n",
      "It's crazy.\n",
      "Might be more than that, but there's a lot of vision impaired people.\n",
      "So you might wanna do that, but you you have a lot of, uh, we were in terms of what you wanna do with, especially with these teams.\n",
      "You also have umm.\n",
      "This mobile layout right?\n",
      "So, so far we've we've seen it from a desktop perspective, right?\n",
      "But we always have our phones.\n",
      "We're always we always are going to consume.\n",
      "We might be on the road.\n",
      "We might wanna consume our reports on our mobile devices and for this reason we we also have this mobile view that you can that you can use, right?\n",
      "And here I can come and change the way everything looks.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And I can also add.\n",
      "Things to it so.\n",
      "Unpin all the time.\n",
      "Actually I don't wanna do that.\n",
      "Ohh, some of these are not working OK.\n",
      "They might.\n",
      "They might have some issues with it, but basically you're you're going to be able to toggle back and forth and change the view accordingly, right?\n",
      "So let me go to another dashboard, actually fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jia, Steven left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan        \n",
      "Play out that is OK.\n",
      "So I I can change things around, right?\n",
      "It might not be the best idea to have like a whole page.\n",
      "It also it like I might wanna take this out because it's it's a little too, uh, distracting, right?\n",
      "Umm so but.\n",
      "But anyways I can I can change all the other ones right?\n",
      "So might wanna keep some stuff I might not wanna keep all of them.\n",
      "Right, so I keep I kept the page here.\n",

      "OK and now this is what it looks like when I scroll through it right?\n",
      "So let me take that out.\n",
      "So so you get a sense of how this works, right?\n",
      "You want.\n",
      "You wanna make your mobile view good also because you don't know how how things are being consumed.\n",
      "You might have.\n",
      "Actually you can find out that that's part of the performance side, but you can find out what percent of people are using your mobile view versus what personal people.\n",
      "What percent of people are using your desktop here and you wanna make sure both of these are good and you wanna publish them, right?\n",
      "Let's go back to the web layout.\n",
      "So that's automatically saved.\n",
      "Also also some other cool features about dashboards, right?\n",
      "I can.\n",
      "I can now do a lot of things.\n",
      "For example, I can manage alerts, so let's say.\n",
      "Let's say you know I'm an executive, right?\n",
      "And I wanna know what the profit margin is and if it dips below a certain point I wanna I want.\n",
      "It's below, let's say.\n",
      "Make this a lot.\n",
      "  % right.\n",
      "I don't need it by the hour.\n",
      "I can have it by    hours, right?\n",
      "Every    hours.\n",
      "That's the time range.\n",
      "I'm OK with and I can say send me an email if this happens to be below this particular threshold, because that is unacceptable.\n",
      "I'm going to, you know, contact uh whoevers in charge of that division and, you know, talk, talk to them. Right.\n",
      "So you can see how this can can be really useful.\n",
      "You can put alerts on any any particular any particular visual.\n",
      "So that's something that can be very useful.\n",
      "So let's see, there's a bunch of other stuff also.\n",
      "You can go to the report, you can open something called focus mode, right?\n",
      "Uh, if you allowed your CSP to be, it's like download the underlying data.\n",
      "You can you can do that.\n",
      "That's all.\n",
      "Also, depending on your settings, right, so there's a lot of cool features there.\n",
      "On top of that, you can also have self serve and Q&A is really useful in.\n",
      "For dashboards, why?\n",
      "Because a lot of times people want to ask their own questions on the underlying data, right?\n",
      "So, similar to how we can create this and power BI and the power BI desktop, we can do this in power BI.\n",
      "On on, on on the Power BI dashboard and I can also.\n",
      "I can also pin set visual so I can ask questions and I can pin it if I think it's good.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I can pin those, so let me find one that might be actually useful.\n",
      "OK, so I think this is useful.\n",
      "I can pin this, put it on my dashboard.\n",
      "And I've created something sort of a self serve right?\n",
      "I can get this information.\n",
      "And I can subscribe to the whole dashboard, right?\n",
      "I can keep track of the dashboard, create a subscription, give it to a bunch of recipients.\n",
      "Maybe people want a weekly update on it, or a monthly update on it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So they can get updates to see.\n",
      "Maybe they have a lot of things that they have to track, so maybe you can automate some type of an update so that people can be on top of it.\n",
      "You can also add comments.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You can also do that for reports, by the way, but you can also do that for dashboards.\n",
      "I can have comments and other people, so if I didn't like something I might say you know.\n",
      "I can say add.\n",
      "Show please fix this. Right.\n",
      "Who's done that before?\n",
      "Please fix to consulting me.\n",
      "I used to.\n",
      "I used to.\n",
      "I used to do consulting.\n",
      "I should get that quite a bit, but yeah, I can put comments and allow people to view view it, right you also.\n",
      "Use it in teams using all kinds of places.\n",
      "So, but there's also something else that is still considered kind of basic, and it's still, umm, something that might be useful, right?\n",
      "So if you go to your data set.\n",
      "Are they might have changed. Where?\n",
      "We can get access to it, so let me get.\n",
      "Such well checks.\n",
      "Yeah. Right here.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "So under underneath your.\n",
      "That's something called get quick insights.\n",
      "Alright, let me find another there's that.\n",
      "So you can do this with your dashboard or you can go as low as your data set and get these insights.\n",
      "Basically, it's going to try to like it's it'll use ML, they are and all the stuff that you're used to hearing about now and you might get some information, right?\n",
      "So this is like a COVID data set, so it's like pulling out some stuff that might be useful.\n",
      "It's not always right though, right?\n",
      "And it might bring something that's kind of useless.\n",
      "So you you do have to take a look at it, right?\n",
      "This is still not.\n",
      "This is an empowered by GPT   or something like that, either, and even if it was, it can still be wrong, right?\n",
      "So take a look at it.\n",
      "These are insights that might be useful.\n",
      "Sometimes I find myself a few insights that I didn't think about and, you know, take a look at it and pin the PIN said like visual, you can pin it, put it in a dashboard.\n",
      "And you know that makes it.\n",
      "That makes some of your job already done for you, right?\n",
      "So that's pretty useful.\n",
      "So that's another cool feature that's in your dashboards as well that you can apply to your dashboards as well.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Any questions so far?\n",
      "Who's used a dashboard here?\n",
      "Anybody use it?\n",
      "Couple or so, umm, one other thing that I wanna go over is something called a.\n",
      "A real time dashboard.\n",
      "I don't have a demo for that one, but it's uh, it's still pretty useful, so let's let's take a look at it.\n",
      "So the way it works.\n",
      "Is that?\n",
      "You can add a tile right?\n",
      "Let me show you as well.\n",
      "And you can get can get it from a real time source.\n",
      "So I can add something called a screaming data set, right?\n",
      "And it can come from different sources, so it can come from maybe I.\n",
      "So if you have a streaming API, imagine like you know some sentiment analysis or you know from some social media site, you can get an API that works.\n",
      "You can also gather from Azure screen like stream analytics if you if you're aware of that and that's a feature in Azure within Azure.\n",

      "So I think this is overall largely easy for most of you.\n",

      "I didn't fully go through what an admin workspace role is.\n",
      "Well, actually I did.\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "I there is there are different levels of admins.\n",
      "I got confused for a second, so I I think you can answer all of these questions.\n",
      "Yeah, I think you should be able to answer all of these.\n",
      "So go for it.\n",
      "So the first one is how is the admin workspace role different from other types of workspace rules?\n",
      "OK, I got one for one.\n",
      "I got beat.\n",
      "Does anybody wanna disagree?\n",
      "So for one and remove any users is only rule that can remove any users.\n",
      "So I got  C's  A.\n",

      "All right.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, like the consensus, I don't think England had any other opinion.\n",
      "It's all seats, so the consensus is see, I'll go with C what feature in Power BI service can can you use to troubleshoot the flow of data from its source to its destination?\n",

      "Sorry, not an admin or a member.\n",
      "Can create, edit or delete content, right?\n",
      "They can all do that.\n",
      "The admin can delete a workspace though, right?\n",
      "They can.\n",
      "They can do a lot more, right?\n",
      "But the admin is the only role that can remove other users also, so that's what they were testing here, right?\n",
      "And here which of the which of the following options is the best description of a workspace?\n",
      "Yeah, a workspace is a centralized repository, right?\n",
      "So it allows you to collaborate with colleagues and team members and so forth, right?\n",
      "And Lineage view is the best way for you to troubleshoot.\n",
      "It's a   ,    foot view, right?\n",
      "It's the best way for you to to kind of see where the source source is, where the source is and where the destination is and how they came to be right.\n",

      "Relationships and and DAX and all that, right?\n",
      "It's not.\n",
      "It's not too bad.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So and then we talked about dashboards, right?\n",
      "We talked about team, we talked about classification real time.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "We talked about all these things.\n",
      "Alright, so let's do a little knowledge check.\n",
      "What is a dashboard?\n",
      "Canvas of report elements that can be built in power BI desktop I canvas and report elements say that can be built in power BI service.\n",
      "That canvas in which you can view the data model of a report, maybe you'll see.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Seems like everybody's saying be.\n",
      "What is one way that reports and dashboards differ?\n",
      "They're the same and reports you have multiple pages and dashboards.\n",
      "You can only have one page.\n",
      "You can only build reports and dashboards in power BI service.\n",
      "I think it's pretty obvious.\n",
      "You you all got it.\n",
      "It is B.\n",
      "Where can we configure and set data alerts?\n",
      "Data alerts can only be set in power BI service on specific visuals such as KPI cards, gauges, and and cards.\n",
      "Data alerts can be set in both paragraph service and desktop on any kind of visual.\n",
      "A, B or C here.\n",
      "I didn't go over this in super detail, but you should have be able to at least cross out one of them.\n",
      "I think that the A's have it.\n",
      "Alright, so let's take a look.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, you you can't put it on a table.\n",
      "I I didn't show you that explicitly, but I think a lot of you were able able to figure that out.\n",
      "You guys are smart, so.\n",
      "Yeah, data alerts can only be used for certain types of visuals.\n",
      "It can't be used for everything, right?\n",
      "And UM it it is a one page, it's only one page.\n",
      "It can goes.\n",
      "It can go pretty.\n",
      "It can go for a it it can be long, but it can't be like multiple pages.\n",
      "Then it just becomes a report, right?\n",
      "So you can theoretically pin multiple pages of a report on dashboard and do that, but yeah, but it's still just one page.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And it can only be built in power BI service.\n",
      "It's not.\n",
      "It's not something that you can do on the desktop.\n",
      "All right, that's awesome.\n",
      "You you did well.\n",
      "All right, so.\n",
      "I think.\n",
      "Let's see.\n",
      "Let's see what else was on the agenda.\n",
      "Few things.\n",
      "God, we had this one.\n",
      "I said I'll I'll show you this one thing or I'll talk about this, but I just wanna double check that I actually said that.\n",

      "\n",
      "Joe San Pietro          \n",
      "Yep, there you go.\n",
      "Alright, so when you add that there you go.\n",
      "Those are the crowds that you're going to need.\n",
      "So just go into dashboards creative tile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Let me just do this way.\n",
      "OK, so let's go check this out.\n",
      "Other tile.\n",
      "\n",

      "Sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe San Pietro          \n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Sensor you ID, humidity, photosensor interest we should the stream alright, so it's coming.\n",
      "It's just some JSON information about radiation level ambient.\n",
      "Photosynthetic, let me read about this real quick.\n",
      "What is this about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe San Pietro          \n",
      "All the ways that we're gonna die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "OK, so it's some sensor data, right?\n",
      "Imagine it's from your doctor's office or something like that.\n",
      "And now?\n",
      "I have the data set so I should be able to just create.\n",
      "So I have I guess Apple screen.\n",
      "So instead of a card, let me make this.\n",
      "I think they were making it a line chart.\n",
      "And the value.\n",
      "Let's just look at it the last minute.\n",
      "There it is.\n",
      "OK, it's bigger.\n",
      "I can change the time through which I see it, but you get the idea right?\n",
      "So this is how it kind of looks like.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Joe is really useful.\n",
      "I didn't know.\n",
      "They we, we we had a sample site that just screamed data.\n",
      "I created one.\n",
      "I always delete it because I don't wanna.\n",
      "I don't want.\n",
      "I don't want my bills to go up too high, so I always delete my Azure stream analytics.\n",
      "Yeah, this is kind of what it looks like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe San Pietro          \n",
      "You have a source cut.\n",
      "This is what one was kind of hidden, but couldn't you have to find the the creds cause it's up a tutorial that has been changed a bunch of times so I'm glad it's still static for us to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Yeah, that's that's super useful.\n",
      "But yeah, so you can take a you can take a look at it and if you.\n",
      "Say for example in this one it it doesn't allow you.\n",
      "It doesn't really allow, so I can change the type, but magine I put it as a gauge right? And?\n",
      "I put a target I can I can do all kinds of things, but let me just put the value to be.\n",
      "And maybe I have a maximum value that I can that I can that I can, you know, just put in there.\n",
      "This one.\n",
      "Interesting, I thought this one should have check card there's line.\n",
      "Temperature.\n",
      "Umm, I thought you would be able to create an alert for that.\n",
      "Interesting, but you can't.\n",
      "I have to look into that, but I thought you should be able to do that.\n",
      "Here you can see.\n",
      "Manage alerts right?\n",
      "I guess you can't do it for this one.\n",
      "Yeah, this is kind of how it works.\n",
      "Right now, the humidity is the same, so it it didn't really change right and you can edit, edit the details as much as you want, change the labels, change the decimal places and so forth.\n",
      "But it's a lot more limited than you know, than something that you might see.\n",
      "Me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Radiation level.\n",
      "I don't even know what this means.\n",
      "I don't know what the units are here, but that's something you can change and add the labels right?\n",
      "So I don't know if radiation label is I have to look it up, but uh, that you can kind of provide that information.\n",
      "So I would change this to now radiation by the minute.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So that's kind of how it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hawi, Aseel left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "OK so.\n",
      "Does that make sense so far?\n",
      "Any questions on real time?\n",
      "Real time visuals and how they might be like, would you consider using this somewhere?\n",
      "Or have you ever used it for any of your projects?\n",
      "Kinda curious.\n",
      "OK, I'll take once in a contact center.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Tell me a little bit about that.\n",
      "So you'd how did you use it?\n",
      "I've always I've always blown away by the use cases.\n",
      "People use it in the most creative ways.\n",
      "So curious about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So we we had some support from the database administrator back then, yeah, he wrote this.\n",
      "A very neat SQL code.\n",
      "Uh, it wasn't our strong suit at the moment.\n",
      "So and we took that SQL code, we put it into power BI and basically we did that option, which I thank you for reminding me how it's done.\n",
      "It's been so many years since I've seen it and we we, we we were able to see the number of calls every    minutes that are coming in and also the service level of the calls achieved within a specific like threshold of seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Njinkeu, Stephanie joined the meeting\n",
      "\n",

      "Umm, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "And felt that like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "So we, we've seen something similar, but not by second like this one, yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "OK, but based on by minutes, I mean you can change it by hour to it doesn't have to be by second, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Uh, but based on that information, like what actionable things did you do like?\n",
      "OK, you know, like this is a number of calls, so you know, OK, once it passes certain threshold.\n",
      "Hey, you know, we we might need more agents and and the contact center or something that.\n",
      "Well, I'm just curious what what you what you'll did without divulging anything too much if you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "So basically, tell the operation managers to collaborate in a better way with the real time advisors in a way that would we would be able to.\n",
      "Yeah, so sad.\n",
      "When I remember this now, we were able to like cancel breaks.\n",
      "Or like, reschedule the breaks in order to accommodate to the increasingly incoming number of call volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Umm, we were able also to umm bring some outbound agents to handle the inbound rush if there is like a very high Russia calls and sometimes we actually had like the quality coaches and the team leaders logging in and taking calls themselves.\n",
      "So it was, it was really useful it it provide it provided us with a stared visibility from from the workforce team with the operations because there there's always this struggle between the workforce team asking operations or telling operations you should do this to keep containing the service level for the day and operations not trying to like be the attorney for their people and rejecting those like harsh suggestions that we come up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "You didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "So seeing the numbers live in front of them was was was was was good for the business in in a way that they are now convinced that they should take an action, otherwise the service level will keep on declining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Got it. Got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "So yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "That that's really useful.\n",
      "That's really useful.\n",
      "So in in some ways it was used in a in a good way.\n",
      "It kept people honest, right?\n",
      "Like you can see in near real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "What?\n",
      "What's going on on the floor without having to be there?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Which is really great, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bassem Sayed, Vodafone          \n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "But at the same time, right it it you know it's it's a tool at the end of the day, right?\n",
      "It depends on how you use it.\n",
      "It would suck to cancel a break, but you know if if the business needed it, maybe at the time they could do it.\n",
      "But hopefully because it led to more sustainable outcomes as well.\n",
      "But yeah, great to know.\n",
      "Great to know.\n",
      "Thank you for that.\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "Alright, so one last thing that we should do, we'll probably, you know be out a little bit early today.\n",
      "This is not the most.\n",
      "Detailed chalk talk after doing after doing modeling everything just gets easier, right?\n",
      "OK so.\n",
      "Basically what I want you to do in this section is let's just have a conversation, right?\n",
      "Let's just have a little conversation.\n",
      "This might take about    to    minutes at most, right?\n",
      "But I want you to you can take it where you like.\n",
      "You can take it in different directions, but basically what I want you to do is say what should you do?\n",
      "Right. You have.\n",
      "You're part of a team, right?\n",
      "You're trying to create a new application, right?\n",
      "You have a team that that consists of developers, testers, PM and stakeholders, right?\n",
      "And basically imagine this this to be created with a.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Like uh, if anyones used power platform so imagine you created a power platform, but you still are.\n",
      "You know, managing all the things that you that you wanna do, like, you know, having bugs you have and your application.\n",
      "How many?\n",
      "Uh, how many defects you have?\n",
      "And so on and so forth. Right.\n",
      "And your uh, making a report.\n",
      "A reports and things like that.\n",
      "How might you go about solving this particular situation? Right?\n",
      "So maybe think of stakeholders as the highest level, right, and the developers as the developers, testers and maybe even PM.\n",
      "And as the lower level like people that are working on on, on the day to day, So what would you do, right?\n",
      "You have all these people.\n",
      "You're creating some application you wanna get.\n",
      "Put a report on, you know, defects and, umm, analytics on your project that's running so far.\n",
      "How would you go about it?\n",
      "Anyone wanna take a stab at it?\n",
      "Put it in the chat.\n",
      "Come off mute.\n",
      "Either way is fine with me.\n",
      "Like, I'll give you a hint if does anybody want a hint.\n",
      "Imagine right, the stakeholder, like I said, wants to look at it in a higher level, right?\n",
      "So what would you do to?\n",
      "What would you do differently for them to take a look at it versus someone like a developer?\n",
      "Maybe thinking that much right.\n",
      "We talked about it today.\n",
      "I'm just trying to make you, uh, use the concepts that you learned today, just making sure that it's solidified in your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "I think you'll plan to create a dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Yeah, that's that's part of it.\n",
      "But can you can you kind of talk through it?\n",
      "Like what would you first do?\n",
      "You have a team, you're building some analytics.\n",
      "What's the first thing you'll do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "I mean, if you look at it from the project management perspective, you need to get the requirements first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Umm OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Once you gather the requirements, then obviously you have to kind of have the developers.\n",
      "Then you know test us to do your reports and then you publish the reports and then create a dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Yeah, that's that's.\n",
      "Yeah, that's what I was going fine.\n",
      "That that's exactly what I want.\n",
      "So let's say, let me just say this is a random application, right? Uh.\n",
      "Let's say this is some gain, right?\n",
      "Some mobile game application, but you know for all of them they have.\n",
      "They wanna analytics on it because they all have, you know.\n",
      "They all have different reports, by the way.\n",
      "This is my drawings for reports, right.\n",
      "They have reports that measure the bugs and the defects and all the other things that you do right from that you get from JIRA, right?\n",
      "So you might get something from JIRA, right?\n",
      "So that's going into here.\n",
      "So what?\n",
      "Salim was saying is the first thing you do.\n",
      "Obviously on the back end you have the requirements for making the application.\n",
      "We're mainly focused on the GOP side of things here, OK?\n",
      "And then he said, OK, so you create the reports.\n",
      "Who is?\n",
      "Who are the stakeholders?\n",
      "Who?\n",
      "I mean who?\n",
      "I mean, I use that work.\n",
      "Who's viewing these reports?\n",
      "What do you think is viewing these reporters?\n",
      "I think Anthony has the right idea so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "I mean, if you're talking about GR reports, normally they are.\n",
      "They are going to be looked at by the project managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "PM's but they might be even shown   developers, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olejnik, Beata left the meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "Yeah, I mean developers, absolutely.\n",
      "They need to look at it, but project manager is kind of the key person to look at those GRF ports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "And testers so that they test application, they know what they know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Umm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "I mean, I my first job in IT was a tester, so I remember this doing this precisely looking at it from a Gera, they made some kind of report do some kind of functional testing or something on the application that that was such a that that that such a like a a entry level role that I remember doing right.\n",
      "So all of these people look at these reports, right?\n",
      "So that how how should they view it?\n",
      "They they all are kind of working on this right?\n",
      "They're all kind of.\n",
      "They're where, and maybe there's multiple applications, right?\n",
      "Where should all these reports be?\n",
      "They should be in a.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What have we learned today?\n",
      "Where should they be?\n",

      "\n",
      "Aravind Sridharan          \n",
      "Yup, exactly. Workspace.\n",
      "So we'll have a workspace that houses all of these reports, right?\n",
      "And can you tell me so now that you know that the testers, developers and PM's are there?\n",
      "You don't need to get overly detailed here, but should they be part of the workspace?\n",
      "And just you know well, what should they be asked, like, don't overthink it, but what should they be part of the workspace?\n",
      "Sadiq yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salim, Jamal            \n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Why Sadiq?\n",
      "Why do you think, uh, like why and and maybe give them, give them sample rules?\n",
      "Like what would you give them as rules, right?\n",
      "The testers?\n",
      "The developers and the PMS.\n",
      "Yeah, that works.\n",
      "They can all be contributors, right?\n",
      "OK, so they can all do that.\n",
      "It doesn't really matter that that's not the point.\n",
      "I just.\n",
      "They just have to have a role because they're all viewing the dashboard and they're all working together right there.\n",
      "They they can look at the minutiae, they can look at the details.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And Anthony was right, once you do all of this, right?\n",
      "The stakeholders, right, the stakeholders, just want the dashboard.\n",
      "Anything you said that way back there, he understood what I was going for, right?\n",
      "They just want maybe have multiple reports right for different applications, right?\n",
      "They just want the visualizations from from all these reports.\n",

      "As the consultant or as the as the person that serves a stakeholder.\n",
      "You would.\n",
      "We did this in one of the quizzes.\n",
      "Yes, you would set alerts, right?\n",
      "Technically the the the sync holder can do that themselves, but let's just assume that they don't know how to do it.\n",
