      "The participants in the meeting are discussing Power BI Desktop and how they use it to create reports and visualizations. They mention publishing the reports to Power BI Service and disseminating them. The focus of the discussion is on visuals within a report. They ask for someone to explain what a visualization is. verbal or written explanation. Visuals allow us to quickly and effectively communicate data and metrics in a way that is easy for the user to understand and interpret. They help to tell a story and make the information more meaningful and impactful. Visuals can represent measures within the data that are relevant and can be easily picked up on by the user. They provide a visual format for displaying metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs) that can effectively convey information and make it easier to comprehend. Overall, visuals are a powerful tool for presenting data and conveying information in a clear and concise manner. The participants are discussing why storytelling is effective in spreadsheets. They mention that storytelling helps to convey information and paint a narrative, making it easier for people with different backgrounds to understand. The goal is to minimize resistance and ensure that everyone comprehends the message. is a discussion about the benefits of using visual data instead of text data for communication. The speaker explains that visual data allows people to understand information more easily and quickly without having to do calculations in their heads. They compare reading a book to looking at visual data, stating that reading takes longer and requires more effort to come to conclusions. They argue that visual data is a more effective means of communication as it conveys the same amount of information in a more dynamic and efficient way. An example of sales and profit data is shown to illustrate this point. The participants are discussing a visual representation of sales and revenue data. The lighter blue represents sales, while the darker blue represents revenue. Without any context, the participants can immediately decipher that sales and profits are improving. They note that the profit improvement is slight, which is expected due to low margins in retail businesses. The participants emphasize the importance of utilizing visualizations as data becomes more complex. The speaker discusses the importance of visualizing data for better results, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. They mention storytelling and ease of use as reasons for using visuals. The speaker then introduces the topic of report etiquette and design principles. They ask for feedback on a visual that appears messy and has too much yellow color. The participants are discussing a dashboard and pointing out various issues with it. They mention that there is no alignment, currency consistency, and too much going on. They also note that the color scheme is not right, the contrast is terrible, and the spacing is inconsistent. They highlight specific elements that are difficult to see or blend with the background. The participants in the meeting are discussing the design flaws in a visual or report. They mention that the background, visuals, and font are not good. They also note the lack of contrast, spacing, and organization. They mention that the donuts in the visual are not placed well and don't make sense. However, they also discuss what is right about the visual, such as it being tidy and organized compared to the previous one. were discussing the importance of better color contrast and simplicity in design. The speaker emphasized the need to use white and blue colors for easy readability. They also mentioned the importance of appropriately sizing elements and keeping the most important information at the top, such as sales growth and cost of sales. The speaker emphasized the importance of maintaining a left-to-right flow and consistency in spacing. They noted that these are some design principles to consider, although there are more aspects to consider. The speaker emphasizes the importance of functionality over aesthetics in design, particularly in terms of color and contrast. They mention that white backgrounds work well with a variety of colors and allow information to be easily read. They also discuss the concept of proximity, ensuring that similar items are placed close to each other. The speaker then introduces Erica Flor and Aravind Sridharan to continue the discussion. The speaker discusses the updated guidelines and expresses appreciation for the improvements made. They mention that the previous guidelines were more vague, but now there are underlying principles that are easier to follow. The speaker asks if anyone has read the guidelines and encourages those who haven't to read them later. They also mention that there is a way to automatically pick more accessible color schemes using accessible themes. easy for people to understand and analyze. But you can also customize these visualizations and create your own themes, right. So you can apply your own custom theme to make the visualizations match your branding or desired look and feel. Additionally, there are third-party tools available that can help you check if you're applying the visualizations correctly. Now let's move on to individual components. Power BI offers standard visualizations that come with the software. These visualizations allow you to present data in a visually appealing manner, using measures and calculated columns. However, you also have the flexibility to customize these visualizations and create your own themes to match your branding. important to note that there is more to visualizing data in Power BI than just consuming information. The speaker wants to define different types of visuals available in Power BI and provide resources for further exploration. They start by discussing area charts, which are commonly used in time series analysis to show how things have changed over time. The speaker mentions that area charts are better at conveying both the change in time and the magnitude of the data. They give an example where the area chart shows that sales or revenue is higher than profit. The speaker discusses the importance of making visuals more visually apparent and using geographies in data analysis. They suggest using maps as a visual tool and incorporating location data such as latitude, longitude, city, state, and region. The speaker also mentions setting bubble sizes to represent metrics like profit, revenue, or sales. They give an example of a map showing high sales in Australia or Oceania. The speaker also mentions the possibility of drilling down into the data using hierarchies. The meeting participants discussed the use of filters and slicers in data analysis. They explained that filters are used to allow end users to customize their data according to their needs, while slicers provide a visual representation of the filter options. The participants also mentioned a new feature called \"school new\" (exact name forgotten) and discussed its relevance. During the meeting, the speaker introduces a feature called smart narrative, which uses machine learning to provide important facts about a page. The smart narrative dynamically updates based on user input, allowing for comparisons and providing contextual information. The speaker demonstrates how the feature can be used to analyze sales data, showing the difference in sales between two years and highlighting specific regions. The speaker emphasizes that there are many useful features like this available. The speaker discusses the use of tables and matrices to present information in a more tabular format. They mention that some people prefer tables, especially in Excel, to see more information in a regular format. They explain that matrices allow for the addition of more information and can be made more complex by adding more rows and columns. Matrices also make it easier to drill into specific items and slice the data in different ways. The speaker discusses slicing and visualizing data in Power BI. They mention the option to slice data by different categories and subcategories, which is useful for those who enjoy using Excel and want to drill down into specific information. They also mention the ability to create hierarchies and easily organize data. The speaker asks if there are any questions about the visuals shown. Viktorija asks about the smart narrative feature in the industry she works in, where they need to update on a weekly basis and summarize information from different areas of business. Aravind explains that smart narrative takes the context of the whole page and explains all the visuals. It can be updated weekly and provides a way to summarize information in one place. The participants are discussing how Power BI has added more AI features in recent years, making it more advanced and useful. They are impressed with the automatic insights provided by the tool, which can analyze data and provide interesting ideas and information. They mention an example of how Power BI identified a sales increase in Australia compared to the previous year. The conversation ends with one participant mentioning that Power BI also recognized the type of data being analyzed. dashboard and provide insights that most business users would find valuable. However, the AI may not always be perfect and may provide extraneous information or not give users exactly what they want. The participants in the meeting discuss the limitations of the AI and suggest that they can't do much to amend or tune it. It seems that the main purpose of the AI is to explain the visuals on the dashboard and provide useful insights. The participants are discussing the limitations of Power BI and its customization options. They mention that moving certain elements in Power BI can affect their visibility. They also discuss the process of manually downloading data into Power BI on a weekly basis. They agree that it would be interesting to explore if Power BI can replace their existing workload. The conversation then moves on to discussing important visuals in Power BI, but they do not go through all of them due to time constraints. In this meeting, the participants discussed different types of visualizations in Power BI, such as line charts, area charts, tables, and decomposition trees. The decomposition tree was highlighted as a useful tool for breaking down data visually. The participants explored how to use the decomposition tree to break down sales by category and subcategory. They also discussed the use of filters and slicers for data analysis. Overall, the meeting focused on various visualization techniques in Power BI. The discussion revolves around a feature called \"A and a cart\" in a data visualization tool. The participants mention different versions of the feature, such as a multi-row card and a KPI. They highlight that it is useful for displaying high-level information and measures. The example used is the average tech profit margin. The participants then discuss how to create the same visualization but for a different category, in this case, the office supply profit margin. The conversation also briefly mentions an upcoming app source. The speaker discusses the concept of marginality and its relevance to business decisions. They mention using a multi-row card to display data, specifically comparing percentages. The speaker suggests that this visual representation can help managers make informed decisions, such as focusing on selling products with higher margins. They emphasize the dynamic nature of the data and the need to adapt strategies based on current market conditions. During the meeting, the participants discussed different types of cards and their visual features. They mentioned a simple card that can be displayed in multiple rows to save space. They also mentioned a new card visual that has more customizable features such as shadows, borders, and images, making it visually appealing. However, they haven't explored all the features of the new card yet. The speaker is discussing the differences in visualization options between two versions of a product. They mention that the newer version looks sleeker and has more customizable features, which can be important for someone who is visually focused, particularly in finance. The speaker believes that these visual enhancements can make a difference in the overall user experience. Another participant then asks a question about how the cards change dynamically when using a slicer. During the discussion, Aravind explains that by default, all the visuals in the data and charts interact with each other. However, there may be instances where some visuals need to remain static. Aravind introduces the concept of \"edit interactions,\" which allows users to specify which visuals should not interact with others. This feature enables users to control how the visuals filter each other based on their preferences. The meeting attendees discuss different visualizations, specifically focusing on a treemap graph. They mention that while pie charts and donut charts are useful for categorizing information, they can become too busy when there are too many categories. The treemap graph is suggested as a visual that can handle more categories but still maintain usefulness. The discussion highlights the importance of choosing the right visualization based on the amount of information being presented. During the meeting, the participants discuss various AI visuals and their usefulness. They mention a line chart that is helpful for analyzing information over the years and tracking changes. They also mention a Q&A feature that allows users to interact with their data in a more natural way. They demonstrate how to ask the AI visual questions, such as requesting information on the top countries by total profit. However, they notice some discrepancies in the maps, such as China being listed as one of the most profitable places while New Zealand is incorrectly labeled as the Netherlands. They speculate that there may be issues with the data quality or latitude settings that need to be investigated. Despite this, they acknowledge that the Q&A feature provides a lot of valuable information. The speaker discusses the use of synonyms in Q&A to improve the user experience. By adding synonyms, users can ask questions in different ways and still get the desired results. This is particularly useful when different people in an organization use different words to convey the same meaning. Adding more synonyms enhances the effectiveness of Q&A. During the meeting, the participants discuss the Q&A setting gear icon and its interesting features. They mention a demo account and how it allows them to go back and add different visuals. They also talk about the different ways people might ask about dates and mention the convenience of having everything in one place. The participants are discussing the features of AI and how they are continuously improving. They mention that the integration with open AI models will make the features even better. They also discuss how the use of AI reduces manual labor and makes tasks easier. They mention the usefulness of KPI and TPI. Aravind asks if they can input their own questions, and Aravind confirms that they can, but there are also suggested questions. The conversation then moves on to discussing the cost of certain orders. During the meeting, Aravind Sridharan suggests sorting the data by sales instead of profit in order to gain more insight. Pavan Pratap agrees with this suggestion. Aravind explains that by sorting the data by sales descending, they can easily see all the information they need and convert it into a visual. He mentions that people often ask questions based on their own perspective, leading to valuable insights. The discussion revolves around the usefulness of visuals in presenting information efficiently. The participants mention that visuals can help answer questions that may not have been considered before and save time in creating them. They also highlight the convenience of having similar visuals grouped together for easier reference. The conversation briefly touches on specific visuals like KPIs and the sum of sales. In this conversation, the speaker is discussing how to analyze and manipulate data to track revenue targets. They mention looking at data on a monthly or yearly basis and setting specific targets. The speaker suggests using colors to indicate whether they are behind or on track with their revenue goals. They also mention that this data analysis can be useful for management teams to track and meet revenue targets. During the meeting, the participants discuss the importance of using visuals in reports to track progress and communicate insights to management. They highlight that reports can have multiple pages to convey important information. The participants also mention that there are additional features available within certain visuals, which can be found under the format tab. They briefly touch on the difference between a regular card and a fancy card, with the fancy card offering more customization options for visualization. Additionally, they mention that they are looking for PPP loans to keep their organization afloat. The speaker mentions that a chart can be formatted to look fancy and nice, but it also has functional features. One of these features is the ability to set a forecast based on available information. The speaker mentions having sales data as an example. They apologize for discussing a topic that is not their own and mention that more details will be provided by someone else. They also mention the ability to add buttons to the chart. The speaker begins by asking if anyone has been told to make their report more accessible and if they have created reports before. Several people respond affirmatively. The speaker then asks if anyone has received feedback about confusion or difficulty navigating a report. The speaker mentions that buttons can be useful in addressing these issues and making the report more user-friendly. The speaker emphasizes that buttons can help users understand how to navigate through the report. Aravind Sridharan discusses the importance of using alt text and intuitive design in reports to make them more accessible and user-friendly. He suggests using arrows instead of traditional navigation to make the reports look more like applications. He also mentions the use of buttons, such as the \"insert\" button, to add information and make the reports more interactive. Bouchaqour, Mustapha joins the meeting during the conversation. the \"insert\" tab on the website. Here, they explore different buttons that can be added to the website to enhance user experience and provide additional information on various topics. The example given is a carbon emissions report, where a button was added to allow users to access more information about the underlying assumptions made in the report. This feature can be applied to any type of content, not just sales-related information. The purpose is to make reports more intuitive and provide users with the necessary information. The participants discuss various features of a reporting tool that make reports more usable. They mention the ability to use bookmarks and clear slicers to enhance user experience. They also mention using arrows and other navigational tools to make reports easy to understand. Additionally, they discuss the Q&A feature, which allows users to ask questions without taking up report space. The speaker wants to go to a specific page called \"demo\" and mentions that they have complete control over the actions on the page. They discuss the possibility of making the action a Q&A and mention that they want to make the buttons intuitive. The speaker also mentions that there will be labs focused on this topic and asks if there are any questions so far. They mention that the questions will be stored for review. During the meeting, Joe San Pietro mentions that there have been recent updates made to a certain product. However, there are technical issues with his audio, causing his voice to break up. Aravind Sridharan asks Joe to double-check his audio, and Bassem Sayed confirms that it sounds good for him. Despite the technical difficulties, Joe continues with his report. Aravind asks if there are any questions regarding the visuals discussed earlier, and suggests that participants can ask their questions in the chat. The speaker asks if there are any other questions and checks if everyone is understanding the information. They mention that it's post lunch and everyone might be feeling a little tired. The speaker suggests taking a short break to let the information sink in and get some water. Some participants leave and others join the meeting. After the break, the speaker mentions that it was good to have a break and continues with the discussion. The speaker has made some changes to their chart and is explaining how the formatting works. They click on a visual and a format pane pops up, resembling a paintbrush. They can add a title, center it, make it bold, and change its color. They mention that each visual has its own set of features and options for formatting. The speaker discusses the different format opportunities available for visualizations, such as adding dates and different visual properties. They mention that line charts have their own set of properties and can include trend lines, alt text, and customizable icons. The speaker also explains the concept of a tooltip, which provides additional context when hovering over an element. They mention that tooltips can be turned off if desired. The speaker then mentions Anthony's question about Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and how visuals can automatically change color to red if below target and green if above target. During the meeting, participants discuss swapping colors and making changes to a visual or theme. They mention applying an accessible theme and adjusting the color scheme. The participants also mention not wanting to get into a forecast and discuss combining something into one major chalk talk. Aravind Sridharan discusses the use of visuals in Power BI during a meeting. He mentions a scatter chart that allows users to track changes over time. He also introduces the concept of custom visuals and explains that users can access additional visuals from a platform called App Source. The speaker discusses the use of third-party software in organizations. Microsoft provides a check mark to indicate approved software, but some organizations still prefer not to use third-party software. The speaker mentions using Sandy charts for financial analysis and finds them useful. They also mention other visual tools such as Sankey charts and slicers. The speaker introduces a feature called the chicklet slicer in Power BI, which provides a more visual way to view information. They mention that there are many visual options available and encourage users to explore and play around with them. However, they also acknowledge that Power BI may not always provide all the desired functionalities, and suggest removing certain visuals that may work better outside of Power BI. The speaker then introduces the combo chart feature, which allows for the combination of different types of charts, such as a bar chart and a line chart, to measure multiple variables simultaneously. They provide an example of using a combo chart to measure sales and profit margin. During the meeting, the speaker discusses the importance of maintaining a good profit margin as sales increase. They mention that it may not always be possible to achieve this but suggest regularly checking the profit margin. The speaker then asks if there are any questions about combo charts or custom visuals. One participant, Christian, asks if it is possible to present two different years on the same graph using a combo chart. Stephanie suggests using a bar chart to show the sales for each year and a line chart to show the comparison between the two years. Aravind asks for clarification on what is meant by \"two years.\" The summary ends here. Stephanie is discussing with Aravind about creating a chart that compares the profit sales of two different years. She wants the chart to show the blue bar chart and also include a line representing the profit margin for both years. Aravind suggests that it is possible to do so but it would require a more complex calculation. Stephanie agrees and expresses her interest in this approach. During the meeting, Njinkeu asks if it is possible to achieve something on a monthly rolling period in a library. Aravind suggests writing the question down and posting it in the chat or on the advanced alley Clarkson board. He mentions that personal questions can be answered in office hours. Although there are ways to achieve it, Aravind does not provide further details. During the meeting, the participants discuss the issue of showcasing something that takes up time. Aravind suggests that there is a way to do it without wasting time. They also discuss the possibility of creating special tooltips or a whole page dedicated to tooltips. Aravind demonstrates an example of a different-looking tooltip on the first page. The speaker is explaining different types of tooltips and their uses. They mention a regular tooltip and a special tooltip that is used in a lab setting. The speaker also talks about a tool called a gauge, which is used to measure against targets. They explain that a gauge can be given a target, a sum of values, and a minimum and maximum value. The speaker emphasizes that these tools can be customized to provide more context and enhance the user experience. The speaker discusses the use of targets in analyzing sales data. They mention setting a target and formatting it based on the current sales numbers. They also mention a visual tool called the decomposition tree that helps analyze key elements influencing sales. Another tool, similar to the decomposition tree, is mentioned but not demonstrated. During the meeting, the participants discussed various types of visualizations, including line graphs, bar graphs, scattered charts, tables, matrices, narratives, and custom visuals. They acknowledged that there are many differences between these visualizations. The participants also mentioned that there is more to cover, but they wanted to keep it simple for now. They highlighted the concept of edit interactions, which allows customization of interactions between visuals. By default, all visuals interact with each other unless specified otherwise. The speaker discusses various features in PowerPoint and Power BI that allow users to customize their presentations and reports. These features include aligning visuals, using bookmarks to switch between different states of a report, and saving the state of a particular page. The speaker mentions that bookmarks are similar to buttons and can be used to save and switch between different visual states. In the meeting, Aravind Sridharan discusses the use of card visuals. He mentions that sometimes they can be difficult to use because other visuals can filter cards, but cards cannot filter other visuals. However, he suggests that card visuals can be used to build subsets of data and can be used as filters by creating additional filters or slicers. Aravind also mentions that for most use cases, cards do not need to be used as filters. The participants are discussing the use of tables and cards in Power BI. One participant mentions using a regular table as a card but finds it time-consuming. They inquire about a new card that might enable them to filter the other way around. Another participant clarifies that the new card does not have that feature and explains that cards are designed to be more static. They suggest using a workaround instead. The participants are discussing how to design a report for a superstore. They mention using additional filters or slicers to handle the data. They are at the stage of designing the report and are looking for ways to showcase sales with the time dimension. They discuss going step by step to solve the problem. During the meeting, the participants discussed the need for sales information presented over time. They decided to use a line chart to visualize the data. The challenge was that they were only seeing one data point and wanted to see it over time. It was suggested to add time to the X-axis by linking it to the date table. The speaker is discussing how to use a slicer in a data visualization tool. They mention that there is a new slicer feature, but they don't want to spend time exploring it at the moment. They also mention that there are other features like labels and markers that can be added to the visualization. The speaker discusses various features and functionalities within a tool or software. They mention being able to change line styles to differentiate between different lines, adding labels and trend lines, and using a zoom slider to easily navigate and analyze data. The speaker also mentions the ability to format data and highlights the surprising capabilities of the tool. Salim and Jamal have a question about how to create a slicer that only affects one visual on a page. Aravind explains that you can edit the visual to be filtered by specific slicers. By clicking on the visual, going to format, and editing the interactions, you can choose which visuals are allowed to slice the information. Aravind demonstrates how to change the interaction and mentions that it immediately takes effect. The participants are discussing the possibility of having two visuals on a page and controlling the effect of a slicer. They mention using a matrix and a regular slicer. The conversation is ongoing and they are still trying to figure out how to achieve their desired outcome. In this meeting, Aravind Sridharan demonstrates how to use a date slicer to affect specific visuals in a report. Initially, the date slicer affects both visuals, but Aravind wants to change it so that it only affects one visual. He explains that he can achieve this by selecting the visual, going to \"edit interactions,\" and choosing to ignore the filter. Salim and Jamal understand the process and confirm their understanding. The conversation ends with Aravind mentioning that there are other ways to achieve the same result, but they won't be discussed in this meeting. The participants in the meeting are discussing how to visualize revenue with a target. Jamal suggests using a KPI visual that has a target value. Aravind agrees and adds the KPI visual with the sales data and an \"extremely insane\" target. The speaker is discussing how to track progress towards a target. They mention looking at progress by month and updating the target to a more reasonable one. They note that by lowering expectations, one can always be ahead of schedule. The speaker also mentions the ability to change the target and color in the tracking tool. They ask for guidance on how to change the color and are directed to access the line and go to the Y-axis. In this conversation, Aravind Sridharan suggests making a change to the desktop layout. Salim and Jamal comment on the differences in Aravind's desktop and ask how he configures it. Aravind explains that he will make a change to align his desktop with everyone else's. The speaker mentions that they had changed some settings in the past but will now change them back to make it more familiar. They discuss the format tab and its location, mentioning that it is always present and used to format visuals. They also mention that there are different locations for certain features, but it is not a major concern. The speaker assures that they will make the necessary changes soon. The participants are discussing new features and changes in the IT product. They have observed that when clicking on a visualization, it now takes them to the formatting tab. The main concern is the recent changes made to the product. They discuss the possibility of reverting to older versions to compare and contrast. One participant asks how to filter by category and dates in the product. The participants in the meeting are discussing how to organize and filter data in a spreadsheet. They mention using categories and dates as filters. They also discuss adding a slicer and an additional field to the data. They decide to use both a filter and a slicer to organize the information. One participant suggests adding category data, while another suggests adding date data. They mention copying and pasting the slicer and adding the necessary data. Overall, they are close to finishing their task and are almost done for the day. The speaker discusses the use of slicers and filters in data visualization. They explain that slicers provide a way to filter data visually, allowing users to select specific criteria to view. Filters, on the other hand, are more behind the scenes and not easily visible to end users. The speaker demonstrates how to use advanced filtering options, such as filtering by relative time or specific years. They also mention that filters can be applied to individual visuals or the entire page. The speaker discusses various filters and slicers that can be applied to a page in order to view specific information. They mention that technology can be used as the main filter, and it can be applied to the entire page or a specific date range. They also mention the ability to filter by product type, such as furniture, using page-level or report-level filters. Finally, the speaker asks if anyone knows how to view sales by shipping, indicating that this is the last filter they want to discuss. The participants are discussing how to view sales by ship date instead of order date. They realize that there is an inactive relationship between ship date and sales. They suggest changing the relationship to active or using a DAX function to override the active relationship. They decide to use the DAX function and calculate sales by ship date using the calculated function. The speaker discusses using a relationship function to retrieve information from a sales dataset. They explain how to use an inactive relationship to supersede an active relationship and obtain the desired information. Different visualizations can be created, such as line charts, depending on the data and preferences. The speaker mentions the need to add dates and slice the data accordingly. They conclude the discussion by stating that all questions have been answered and invite further questions via chat. The speaker in the meeting requests to stop the recording because there is only a few minutes left. Aravind Sridharan ends the transcription at this point.\n"
